# Normality Tests, p-values, and transforming data distributions to a near Gaussian shape with Python

## Introduction
In statistical analysis there are usually three ways to explore data for a normality contrast or normality test, where we want to find how close a given distribution is to a normal one.
- Graphical representation of the data distribution.
  - Histogram
  - Boxplot
- Analytic methods.
  - Kurtosis
  - Skewness
- Hypothesis tests.
  - Shapiro-Wilk test
  - D'Agostino's K-squared test
