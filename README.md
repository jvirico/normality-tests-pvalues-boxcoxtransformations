# Normality Tests, p-values, and transforming data distributions to a near Gaussian shape with Python

## Introduction
In statistical analysis there are usually three ways to explore data for a normality contrast or normality test, where we want to find how close is a given distribution to a normal one.
- Graphical representation of the data distribution.
- Analytic methods.
- Hypothesis tests.
